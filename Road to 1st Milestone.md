## Next Steps

1. Use the dashboard repo to setup a basic dashboard prototype for student/teacher with shadcn components
2. Setup the database with PostgreSQL (pg-admin)
3. Implement the initial metrics we decided in the dashboard as an example and use the document to recommend new metrics [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Advanced-Media-Technologies-1f5b19ab3187805abfa1f8ea48dd6403?pvs=4)
4. Try to link every metric we will use with the xAPI verbs & structure
