## Learning Progress Is Composed of Multiple Metrics

- What is the weighting of the individual metrics, and why do some have higher or lower weightings?
- For each metric, there should always be a way to explain or visualize (or briefly describe in text) why the learning progress is, for example, *only* 64% and not higher, as the learner might have expected.
  - ➝ The learner must be able to accept that the learning progress value might fall below their expectations.

## Discussion

Compare your own approach to learning progress with other learning platforms:

- What is their approach, and what is ours?
- Why is our approach better, and in what way?
- What would be an even better approach, but one that is hardly feasible for, e.g., universities?
- Why is this better approach hardly feasible?
- Is our approach a trade-off?
- Why is our trade-off solution a good one?

## Recommender System

### Goal-Oriented

- The next recommendation should help the learner achieve their defined learning goal.

### Learning Path

- For example, a course has 12 learning units (theory and technical foundations).
- Recommendations are made based on the current flow, e.g., initially suggesting only foundational units because the student started independently with them.

### Suggestions

- Recommend courses the student hasn’t explored yet.
- Recommend courses where the student performed well again, to give them a positive feeling.

### Effort

- Very rudimentary.
- Significantly less effort than representing learning progress.
